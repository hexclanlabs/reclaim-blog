c:T412,Let’s say, a User is proving that they have $1000 on their bank account, and the TLS Response from the bank’s website is “Good morning Mike; account number: 123; balance: 1000”. If Reclaim asks the user to disclose one number only (the number that represents the balance), then it would be extremely easy for a User to brute-force the key such that the decryption contains “1000” even at a specific position in the string. However, we can require a User to disclose more bytes of the TLS response to be sure that it is not just a random number appeared in the decryption but indeed the bank balance of the User. Moreover, since the format of the TLS response is well-known to an Attestor (since it is specified by the provider parameters), a User will have to disclose exactly the same bytes as the real TLS response contains (e.g. “account number: ***; balance: 1000”). This makes the brute-force a way more challenging problem. The reason behind this is that a User has to iterate through 2^N keys, where N is the number of 2:["$","article",null,{"className":"container py-6 prose dark:prose-invert max-w-3xl mx-auto","children":[["$","h1",null,{"className":"mb-2 text-center","children":"Infeasibility of Fake Key Reveal attacks"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-center","children":[["$","div",null,{"children":"Madhavan Malolan"}],["$","div",null,{"children":"Oct 12, 2023"}]]}],["$","img",null,{"src":"/posts/06.jpg","alt":"Infeasibility of Fake Key Reveal attacks","className":"rounded","width":1920,"height":1080}],["$","div",null,{"className":"flex gap-2 mb-2","children":[["$","span",null,{"className":"inline-block text-xs font-medium tracking-wider uppercase mt-5 text-purple-600","suppressHydrationWarning":true,"children":"Code"}],["$","span",null,{"className":"inline-block text-xs font-medium tracking-wider uppercase mt-5 text-yellow-600","suppressHydrationWarning":true,"children":"Not Code"}]]}],[["$","p",null,{"children":"The goal of an Adversary in the Fake Key Reveal attacks is to compute a key such that the result of decryption of the TLS response (that came from the Website) using this key will be a plaintext that contains some specific substrings on the Adversary’s choice.
