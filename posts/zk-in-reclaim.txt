Let’s say I want to create a zk proof for ",["$","code",null,{"children":"V'"}]," instead. That would mean, (U, E, S, V’) become fixed and the only free variable is ",["$","code",null,{"children":"D"}],". So I now need to find a ",["$","code",null,{"children":"D'"}]," such that it still satisfies the equation ",["$","code",null,{"children":"Q"}],". And that, is impossible because the only way is to try all the possible values of D, which is 2^64 values. It’ll take millions of years to try out all the values of D on the most powerful computer to find a value of D so that it checks out for the particular ",["$","code",null,{"children":"V'"}]," you want to prove."]}],"\n",["$","p",null,{"children":"Phew."}],"\n",["$","p",null,{"children":["$","em",null,{"children":"Reminder, this post is grossly inaccurate in terms of what actually happens. It is meant only to appeal to intuition."}]}]]]}]
